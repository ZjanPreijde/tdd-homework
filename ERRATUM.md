###codebreaker_spec.rb

 section [D] :  there's no exact match

- If the code is correct, this test will never pass.
- If the test passes, there's something wrong with the code :-)

```ruby
      it "1 exact match and 1 number match (in that order) sends a mark with '+-'" do
        game.start('1234')
        input = '4151'
        expect(output).to receive(:puts).with('+-')

        game.guess(input)
      end
```

Replacing `'1234'` with `secret_number` fixed it.



###codebreaker.rb, codebreaker_spec.rb

"Try guessing a number with four digits"

0 is a digit

->  "Try guessing a number with four digits (1-9)"

I found out that if you fork and clone, then try to push to your fork, the default merge target is the original clone, not the forked one. Maybe check this is correct, and mention this in the README.md if so.
